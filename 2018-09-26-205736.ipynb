In this section, use the %time and %timeit magic commands to compare the efficiency of your implementations for obtaining large numbers of primes (try n of 1,000,000). Which implementation is faster? By how much? Does it match your prediction about efficiency above? Speculate about what is being slow about the slower implementation. When writing your notebook, be sure to present your analysis clearly so that others can read and understand it - we will be exchanging work between groups next week for evaluation."
